 LISTENING signifies a server is passively awaiting a connection request

 ESTABLISHED means a connection is active and data can be exchanged

 TIME_WAIT is a transitional state after connection closure

 LAST_ACK indicates the final acknowledgement of a terminated connection

 and SYN_SENT means a connection request has been sent but not yet confirmed




Port 139 is commonly associated with SMB (Server Message Block) over NetBIOS,
 primarily used for file and printer sharing in Windows networks

Port 51390 is a commonly used port number, particularly for services
 associated with Application Server Java in SAP products


Port numbers between 49152 to 65535 are Dynamic 
ports, also known as private or ephemeral ports.
These ports are not assigned,controlled, or registered,
and are used for temporary or private connections by clients.
They are typically used by client applications when communicating
with servers, which often listen on well-known or registered ports.



Potential Security Risks

Unauthorized Access:
Attackers can use open ports to gain remote access to a system, potentially allowing them to steal data, install malware, or take control of the system. 
Malware Distribution:
Open ports can be used as entry points for malware, which can then spread across a network. 

DDoS Attacks:
Attackers can exploit open ports to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, overwhelming a network with traffic and making it unavailable. 
Vulnerability Exploitation:
Unsecured open ports can expose underlying software or services with known vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for attackers.
 
Injection Attacks:
Open ports, especially those used by database services, can be vulnerable to injection attacks, where attackers manipulate database queries to gain access to sensitive information. 
Insider Threats:
Malicious insiders can use open ports to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

Brute Force Attacks:
Attackers can use automated tools to try different passwords or credentials on open ports, potentially gaining access to systems with weak security. 

Increased Attack Surface:
Every open port adds to the overall attack surface, making the network more vulnerable to attacks.
 
Data Breaches:
Open ports can be a pathway for data breaches, where attackers can access and steal sensitive information. 

Ransomware Attacks:
Open ports can be exploited as entry points for ransomware attacks, which can encrypt sensitive data and demand a ransom for its release.
